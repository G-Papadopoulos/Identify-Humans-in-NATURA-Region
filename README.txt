This work was part of a team term project, where the goal was to estimate the number of visitors in a NATURA region, respecting the privacy of the visitors (e.g. no cameras allowed).

"identify-humans-export" has the data downloaded from the project workspace (https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/80560).

Some .png files are also attached for a brief overview.

All data were taken in an outdoor environment, expect the "testing" labeled data (only used for testing), which were taken inside the lab, while the presentation of the project was taking place.
